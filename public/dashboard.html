          <p>Many international students studying in the United States would like to work in order to earn some extra
            money or to help with the bills. However, as an international student, you are very limited in the work you
            are allowed to participate in. All types of employment must be approved by your DSO prior to you working.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working in the U.S. without the proper authorization is a serious violation of the terms of your F-1 visa.
            If you work begin working without approval, your DSO is required by federal law to report the violation
            through SEVIS and your I-20 may be terminated. This means you will have to leave the U.S. immediately and
            may not be allowed to return.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, there are certain circumstances that allow you to work while studying in the U.S. These are
            listed below but if you have any questions regarding your employment options, speak to your DSO.

            With OPT authorization, you are legally able to work anywhere in the United States for up to 12-months as
            long as the work relates to your field of study. In order to be approved for OPT, you must submit an
            application to USCIS requesting permission. This process usually takes 90-days but when you are approved,
            you will receive an Employment Authorization Document (or EAD Card). There are two different types of OPT
            that you may be able to apply for:

            course at a different school with Concurrent Enrollment. The rules of Concurrent Enrollment state that as
            long as you are enrolled for a certain number of credits at the school where your I-20 was issued (your
            primary school), you can take a class at another school (a secondary school) to equal full-time enrollment.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Enroll in at least 7-credits at your primary school and 5-credits at your second
            school to equal 12-credits.</p>
          <p>
            In order to learn more about Concurrent Enrollment at your school, speak to your International Advisor to
            see if this is a possibility for you. Each school will have a different policy regarding this but you
            generally will need the following documents to be approved:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A reduced course load form or concurrent enrollment form</li>
